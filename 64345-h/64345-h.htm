<p class="ph3">A STORY.<br />
BY CHARLES GIBBON,<br />
<span class="smcap">Author of ‘Robin Gray,’ ‘Queen of the Meadow,’ ‘The Golden Shaft,’ etc.</span></p>


<h3>CHAPTER I.—THE OVERTURE: ‘MUCH VIRTUE IN IF.’</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sun still bright on the hilltop; figures
rising to its crest, and there halting, with hands
shading their eyes, to take a glad or sad look
backward. Then, impelled by the master Time,
they move downward through deepening shades
to join the great crowd in the bosky glen at the
foot of the mountain. Mingling in the crowd,
they become themselves shadows, making strange
shapes in the beautiful garden ground where
they find rest.</p>

<p>But in that pause on the bright hilltop, in
that look back along the slope which has been
climbed, there falls a mist from the eyes. There
is the straight easy road up to the height which
we might have taken, and there are the devious
paths like the mazy involutions of the lines on
a railway map, which we have taken, and which
have made the journey appear so wearisome to
many, so short to the happy few.</p>

<p>But all see what a much pleasanter road they
could travel if they might only start afresh with
this new vision.</p>

<p>Old friends meet and exchange compliments
about birthdays—some accepting them contentedly,
others regarding them as grim jokes
which would be honoured in the omission. But
gay or sad, every one has in the heart a plaintive
note which sounds that monosyllable ‘IF!’</p>

<p>‘If I had only been advised at the right
moment, how different it would be with me
now,’ sighs the pallid invalid, closing his eyes
in vain and trying to forget.</p>

<p>Then the sad-faced maiden:</p>

<p>‘If he had only trusted me a little more—if
I had only doubted him a little less, how sweet
it would have been to have gone down this hillside
hand in hand together.’</p>

<p>‘If I could only have persuaded him not to
make that last journey,’ murmurs the widow.</p>

<p>‘If my son had been spared,’ moans the
childless.</p>

<p>‘If I had known his falsehood,’ bitterly
exclaims the betrayed.</p>

<p>‘I wish the guv’nor’s cash had not gone so fast,’
mutters the spendthrift, ‘and it might have lasted
long enough to have made this an easy slide, if
I had only thought about it. Now I suppose
it will be a regular plunge.’</p>

<p>‘If I had only left off play before my luck
turned,’ growls the gambler.</p>

<p>‘If I had left those shares alone I would have
been all right,’ says the bankrupt.</p>

<p>‘Looking back, sir, is seldom pleasant,’ says
the successful man with a complacent smile and
with a wave of his hand patronising the whole
past, ‘but to me it is agreeable enough. The
struggle was hard, sir, hard; and if it had not
been for untiring energy on my part—well, I
should not be where I am. But if I had it
all to do over again, why, I could double my
fortune.’</p>

<p>But he is content enough to go gently down
the slope in his carriage, whilst others are tumbling
or creeping down the same course bearing
that burden ‘If.’ The miserable ones know that
their state would have been more gracious if
they could have seen the way more clearly; but
they have no wish to go back; they crawl voiceless
over the hilltop, in haste to reach the end
of the journey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>{2}</span></p>

<p>‘Cheated of my due,’ the man of ambition cries;
‘but if there had been a fair field for me I would
have accomplished all my aims, and the world
would have been the gainer.’</p>

<p>‘Let us walk steadily on,’ says the philosopher
gently, ‘and our memories of the sunlit streaks
on the other side will cheer us on our way
downward. There is no life that has not some
pleasant memory that will bring a sense of happiness
to the most desolate—if it be not thrust
aside by vain repining. All men and women
may be happy, if’——</p>

<p>Oh, that infinite ‘If!’</p>


<h3>CHAPTER II.—WHAT MIGHT BE.</h3>

<p>The place was the garden of Willowmere. The
time was the middle of August, when trees and
fields and bracken were faltering into that full
ripeness which bodes decay. At that period, note
the gradation of hues in the forest land—from
deep watery green to pale, sensitive yellow, every
leaf trembling in the sunlight with ever-changing
shades. In the garden the forward apples were
showing ruddy cheeks, and the late pear presented
a sullen gray green.</p>

<p>The persons were Madge Heathcote, niece of
Richard Crawshay, the sturdy yeoman farmer of
Willowmere, and Philip Hadleigh, son of the
master of Ringsford Manor.</p>

<p>She was somewhat pale and anxious: he was
inclined to hustle her anxiety aside with the
blissful hopefulness of youth and indifference to
consequences.</p>

<p>‘I am going to give you very bad advice,
Madge; will you listen to it?’</p>

<p>‘Is it very bad?’ she asked, lifting her eyes, in
which there was an expression curiously compounded
of pathos and coquetry.</p>

<p>‘Very bad indeed,’ he responded cheerfully,
‘for I am going to tell you that you are not to
mind your uncle at all, but be guided by me
now, as you will be, I hope, at no very distant
date.’</p>

<p>‘But you know he always liked you, Philip,
and you must have done something—something
awfully bad to have made him turn so suddenly
against you.’</p>

<p>But although she tried to make him believe
that she was quite sure he had done something
very wicked, she somehow failed to impress the
youth with any deep sense of her indignation.</p>

<p>‘I cannot measure the degree of my iniquity
until you give me some hint as to what it
is.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t you know?’</p>

<p>‘On my honour I do not. My conscience is as
clear of it as your own. Now speak—tell me
my crime.’</p>

<p>‘If you don’t know what it is,’ she said slowly,
whilst she studied intently a weed that had grown
in the path and which now sprouted at her
restless foot. ‘If you really don’t know what it
is—I think we had better say nothing about
it.’</p>

<p>‘Very well and with all my heart. Still I
can’t help thinking that your uncle might have
come to me, or allowed me to go to him, before
he made up his mind that we should never pull
together.’</p>

<p>‘He did not say that exactly’——</p>

<p>‘Would you have believed him if he had?’ he
interrupted, with an under-current of laughter in
his voice and yet with a shade of curiosity in his
expression.</p>

<p>She looked at him. That was enough. The
pale blue eyes, which seemed in extreme lights
quite gray, had that wistful, trustful expression
of a dog when being chidden by a loved master
for some offence of which it is innocent. But
presently the expression changed to one of
thoughtfulness, the flush faded from her cheek,
and she again sought inspiration from the weed
at her foot.</p>

<p>‘How can I tell you what I might believe
about the future? All that I know is—I trust
you, and am content’——</p>

<p>‘That’s my Madge,’ he said in a low glad tone,
as he clasped her hand.</p>

<p>‘At the same time,’ she went on gravely, ‘you
must remember that Uncle Dick has not only
been good and kind to me; but he has, besides,
shown himself wise in the advice he has given
to others, and it would be very wrong of me not
to think seriously over anything he may counsel
about my future.’</p>

<p>‘Now you are playing Miss Prim, and I don’t
admire you in that character. I like your uncle
and respect his judgment—except of course in
the present instance’—— Then, suddenly checking
himself: ‘But what <i>did</i> he say?’</p>

<p>‘Not very much, but he was in earnest. He
told me that if I cared for myself or cared for
him, I was to have nothing more to do with any
of the Ringsford Manor people.’</p>

<p>‘That was when he came home from the market
yesterday?’</p>

<p>‘Yes—but you must not think’——</p>

<p>‘No, no—I was not suspecting him of having
stayed too long at the <i>King’s Head</i>, although I
daresay he might not be so cool as when he
started in the morning. I know that he would
be out of humour with our people, for he had
some dispute with my father, old Cone tells me.
Whether it was about the price of corn, or a pig,
or the points of a horse, is known only to themselves,
but they parted in a bad temper. You
will see that your uncle will not bear me malice
on that account. Did he say anything else?’</p>

<p>‘Yes.’ Her lips trembled a little and she did
not seem disposed to continue.</p>

<p>‘Well, out with it,’ he exclaimed cheerfully.</p>

<p>‘He said—that—he wished he saw you fairly
off on your wildgoose chase.’</p>

<p>Philip understood now why the lips had trembled
and why the words came from her lips with
so much effort.</p>

<p>‘Poor Madge,’ he said gently as he drew her
arm under his own and patted the hand which
rested on his wrist.</p>

<p>Then they walked together in silence.</p>

<p>He was a broad-shouldered, stalwart fellow,
with short, curly, brown hair, a moustache of
darker hue; chin and cheeks bare. His was a
frank, sanguine face—Hope flashing from the
clear eyes and brightening all the features. The
square brow, the well-defined lines of nose and
jaws, were suggestive of firmness; the soft curves
of mouth and chin dispelled all hints of hardness
in the character. A resolute but not an obdurate
man, one might say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>{3}</span></p>

<p>She was tall and graceful, age between twenty-three
and twenty-five, but in certain moods she
appeared to be much older; and in others no
one would have thought that she was quite out
of her teens. Long regular features; silken hair
that had once been very fair but had darkened
as she grew in years; a quiet, self-possessed
manner which made all comers easy in her presence,
instantly inspiring confidence and respect.
Some people said she had more influence over
the labourers in the parish than the parson
himself. The parson’s wife—although a kindly
woman in her way—never had anything like
the success of ‘Missie’ Heathcote, as she was
affectionately called by the working-folk, in persuading
Hodge to give up his extra pot of a
Saturday and inducing Hodge’s ‘old woman’ to
keep her cottage and her children neat.</p>

<p>To Philip Hadleigh in his calmest ravings about
her she was the most beautiful creature in all
woman-nature. He had learned Wordsworth’s
lines about the ‘noble woman nobly planned’ who
was yet ‘not too bright or good for human nature’s
daily food,’ and he was never tired of repeating
them to himself. They presented a perfect portrait
of Madge. She, too, was beautiful in mind
and body—true, earnest, devoted. She would die
for the man she loved; she could never be false
to him. And he had won that love! He did
not know how, or why or when. He was dazed
by his great fortune. He could not realise it; so
he shut his eyes and was happy.</p>

<p>But ‘Missie’ Heathcote herself knew that she
was capable of saying and doing very foolish
things. She feared that she was capable of Hate
as passionate and fierce as her Love.</p>

<p>So far all had gone smoothly with them. True,
their engagement was between themselves; there
had been no formal asking of the sanction of her
uncle and guardian’s leave, or of his father’s
approval. But everybody knew what had been
going on and no objection had been raised. In
his easy way Philip took for granted that those
who had any right to their confidence understood
everything and did not require him to go through
the conventional explanations. She had not considered
explanations necessary until they should
come to the arrangements for the wedding-day.</p>

<p>Their elders did understand: Mr Hadleigh of
Ringsford was indifferent or too proud to proffer
even to his son advice which was not asked:
Crawshay of Willowmere was content to let Madge
please herself. He thought her choice a good one,
for he liked Philip and believed in him. Of
course in the way of money and position she might
have done better. (Was there ever a parent or
guardian of a girl who did not think that ‘she
might have done better?’) Hadleigh was a
wealthy man, but his ownership of Ringsford was
of recent date, and although he was doing everything
in his power to secure recognition as one
of the county families, all his riches could not
place him on a level with Dick Crawshay, whose
ancestors had been masters of Willowmere from
a period before the arrival of the Conqueror—going
back to the time of the Romans, as was
sometimes asserted.</p>

<p>Crawshay was not a man of prejudice when
he considered things calmly. So, in this matter
of his niece’s choice of a partner, he was content
since she was satisfied.</p>

<p>In this way it happened that the heads of
the houses had given no formal consent to the
proposed marriage; and now that a quarrel had
arisen, each felt free to approve or disapprove of
it in accordance with his own humour.</p>

<p>Madge regarded the quarrel—as she was inclined
to regard most matters—with serious eyes. Philip
was convinced that it was nothing more than a
petty squabble—a few angry words spoken in
a moment of temper, which both men were no
doubt ashamed of and would be glad to have
forgotten. He was not disturbed about that
unpleasant little event.</p>

<p>What elicited that sympathetic whisper ‘Poor
Madge’—and what had kept them silent so long
as they passed down by the dense old hawthorn
hedge to the orchard, was a matter of much more
importance than the falling-out of their elders.
At length, he continued:</p>

<p>‘Would you like me to give up this business
of mine altogether?... We can do without
it.’</p>

<p>‘No; I should not like that at all,’ she answered
with prompt decision. ‘You believe the result
will be of great advantage to your father’s firm
and to yourself; the experience will certainly
be valuable to you; and when you come home
again!’——</p>

<p>‘Ah, when I come home again—that will be
a glad day,’ he said with subdued enthusiasm.
‘Let me take up the picture where you laid
down the brush.... When I come home again
there will be a little conversation with the vicar.
Then two young people—just like you and me,
Madge—will march into the church on a week-day.
The parson will be there and a few friends
will be there, and we shall all be very merry.
Next will come a sweet month when these selfish
young people will hide themselves away from
all the world in some out-of-the-way nook, where
they will make a joyful world of their own in
being together, knowing that only death is to
part them now. Won’t that be good fun? Do
you think you will like it?’</p>

<p>‘I think so,’ she answered, smiling at his fancy
and blushing a little at the happy prospect.</p>

<p>‘Next they return to their cottage by the wood;
and the lady is busy with her housekeeping, and
the man is busy admiring her more and more
every day, finding new beauty in her face, new
love in her heart as the years go on. They will
not be always alone, perhaps; and when they
are old she will be a sweet-faced dame with
beautiful white hair, and there will be strong
young arms for her to lean upon as she goes
to church on Sunday. The old man will totter
by her side, resting on his staff, and still her
lover—her lover till death do them part....
What do you say to that fine forecast?’</p>

<p>‘Ay—if it might be, Philip,’ she said with
a bright smile—a hint of tears in its brightness,
for she had followed his vision of the future with
tender sympathy throughout.</p>

<p>‘Will you try to make it what I have so often
dreamed it may be, should be—must be?’</p>

<p>‘I will try.’</p>

<p>His arm was round her waist: they were
sheltered by the apple-trees and the great hedge:
he kissed her.</p>

<p>‘Then that’s all right,’ was his glad comment;
‘and now I am going to hunt for Uncle Dick,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>{4}</span>
and have it out with him for playing such a
wicked joke upon us. I won’t say good-bye, for
I shall be coming back with him. I don’t think
I shall say good-bye until—— Why are you
so troubled about this trip, Madge? It is really
nothing more than a trip, and there is still time
enough to give it up altogether.’</p>

<p>‘You are not to speak of that again,’ she replied
with playful reproach. ‘It was your mother’s
wish.’</p>

<p>‘So be it. But here is a new idea!’</p>

<p>‘Are you sure it is new?’</p>

<p>‘Quite. Suppose we pay that visit to the church
before I start, and then we could travel together?
That would be capital.’</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>‘You know it would never do. You would
either neglect the purpose of your journey, or
neglect <i>me</i>—and that would be a terrible
crime!’</p>

<p>‘I am not likely to commit it, and if I did you
would forgive me.’</p>

<p>They had reached the stile at the end of the
orchard, and he vaulted over it. His foot slipped
as he descended, but he saved himself from falling
by clutching the top bar of the stile.</p>

<p>‘That is not a good omen,’ said Madge, laughing
gently; ‘you ought to have been content to
clamber over like other people.’</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A traveller</span>, visiting any of the monastic ruins
which adorn the loveliest of our valleys, cannot
but be impressed by the changes time works on
institutions and systems. These piles, stately in
their desolation, remain as landmarks of a system,
which, after holding sway for centuries, was suddenly
swept away. Like all social institutions, the
monastic orders supplied a public want, and when
it was no longer needed, the system disappeared.
Many institutions, after having fulfilled their
purpose, develop into abuses, and so to some
extent counteract the good effect they had formerly
produced, and this doubtless applies to the
case of the monasteries. The noble architecture
and great extent of these ruins show us the skill
and enthusiasm displayed by the early workers of
these orders; their utter ruin, while it has made
the whole appear more picturesque, shows the
inevitable end of institutions which outlive their
usefulness.</p>

<p>As long ago as the fifth century, it was the
custom for devout men to form themselves into
societies, apart from the world, that their lives
might be untainted by its evil influences. The
leader in this movement was St Benedict, an
Italian monk, whose followers, naming themselves
after him, gave to their order the name of
Benedictines. These men, spreading themselves
over France and England, were the pioneers of
the later monastic orders. They lived in the
most extreme poverty, choosing the most forsaken
and barren regions for their homes. Thus, we
find them in the days of the Saxon, founding in
a marsh beside the Thames the abbey of Westminster;
in the district of the Fens the abbey of
Crowland; in the swamps of the west the abbey
of Glastonbury; whilst farther north, on wild
headlands overlooking the North Sea, rose the
abbeys of Whitby and Lindisfarne. But our
knowledge of the life passed by the inmates of
these sanctuaries is extremely scanty. The times
were too turbulent to allow the monks much time
for study, and although Cædmon and Bede have
left glimpses of this age in which they lived, their
scanty records are only as flashes in the darkness.
The Danes harassed the land incessantly; and
the monasteries, as representing a religion they
hated, were with them especial objects of attack.
Crowland Abbey was given to the flames, and the
abbeys of Whitby, Lindisfarne, and Tynemouth
were sacked and destroyed.</p>

<p>After the Conquest, the Norman abbots gave
a new energy to a system which was becoming
somewhat stagnant, and by the twelfth century,
this new impetus had reached its climax. Then
rose the monasteries whose ruins make Yorkshire
scenery doubly attractive. The abbeys of Fountains,
Bolton, Rievaux, and Kirkstall, were all
commenced in this period, amid surroundings far
different from those which make these districts
so attractive to the modern traveller. One consideration
in choosing the site of the abbey is
worth notice. It was always near to a running
stream, from which the brethren might obtain
their supplies of fish. Thus, we never think of
Bolton Abbey without the Wharfe, or of Melrose
without the Tweed.</p>

<p>In every monastic establishment, the principal
feature was the abbey, or chapel, consisting of nave,
chancel, and transepts, built on the plan of a cross.
Here, the monks assembled for prayers, which seem
to have been of such wearisome length that artificial
means were invented to counteract their soporific
effect. In the chancel of Westminster Abbey
may be seen the seats ingeniously contrived to
throw on to the floor any monk who allowed
himself to be overcome by the monotonous routine
of prayers. Adjoining the abbey was the chapter-house,
where the abbots from the neighbouring
monasteries formed a chapter to discuss matters
of church interest, and to sit in judgment on
those of their brethren who had transgressed.
And although it is well known that the origin
of the dispute between Becket and the king was
the leniency shown by these chapters to their
own priesthood, when the plaintiff was a layman,
yet in cases where the interests of the church
were at stake, these priestly judges did not hesitate
to inflict even death itself on the delinquent.
Readers of <i>Marmion</i> will be reminded of the
fate of Constance; and the discovery within
recent times of a skeleton immured in a vault
of Coldingham Abbey in Berwickshire, may perhaps
serve to suggest that this was not an uncommon
method of inflicting death.</p>

<p>The refectory, which in many ruins shows least
signs of decay, corresponded to the modern dining-hall,
and was often a noble and spacious apartment.
But the most important of the abbey
buildings, in our eyes, was the Scriptorium—the
abbey library and study. Here were preserved
and copied the writings of the times, and the
greater part of our history, prior to the sixteenth
century, is owing to the work of these priestly
scribes.</p>

<p>The monks formed independent colonies, asking,
and indeed needing, no help from the world
around them. At first, their lands in many
instances were small in extent, and their poverty
was amply sufficient to deter any but devout<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>{5}</span>
men from casting in his lot with them. Poverty
and work they considered the two great antidotes
against sin. Even in those early times, they were
fully acquainted with the adage which connects
mischief with idle hands. Their employments
were as various as their tastes. The building
of the abbey must have furnished employment
for several generations of monks. The stained-glass
windows and the bells of their churches
were their own handiwork. Visitors to the
Patent Museum at South Kensington are attracted
by the loud ticking of a clock, still said to be a
capital timekeeper, although the three centuries
of its infancy were passed in measuring time for
its makers, the monks of Glastonbury. As further
instances of the versatile occupations of the monks,
it will be remembered that Roger Bacon, the
inventor of the common lens, was a Franciscan.
Gardening, too, occupied much of their time, and
we even read of Becket and his monks tossing hay
in the harvest-field.</p>

<p>But as time went on, the abbey lands became
extensive, by the grants of men who thought to
compensate for their misdeeds by becoming liberal
in their dying hours to mother-church. In the
course of time, the abbots had become in reality
great landowners, and monks only in name.
From a glimpse left us of the state of affairs
round the abbey of St Edmonsbury, it is plain
that the abbot was held more in awe by the
surrounding tenantry than the king himself. The
abbot of Furness was virtual lord over the country
north of Morecambe Bay from the Duddon to
Windermere; and the estate of the abbey of
Fountains stretched to the foot of Penygant, a
distance of thirty miles.</p>

<p>As numerous instances have shown, wealth is
a power, which, if not wisely used, may not only
demoralise individuals, but communities and
nations. The abbeys, whose walls had been
raised to encircle piety and poverty, became in
time the abodes of indolence and luxury. Indeed,
it is probable that the scanty knowledge we
possess of our country’s history during the two
centuries prior to the destruction of the monasteries,
is owing to the fact that the monks,
who had formerly been our chief historians, had
thrown aside a task which few others were
then competent to take up. The new learning,
which carried knowledge outside the monasteries,
had not yet sprung into being, and the only
learned sect in the land had become idle.</p>

<p>The monastic system, had it been allowed to
live on, would certainly have met with a severe
check, if not destruction, in the religious reforms
which took place in the reigns of Edward VI.
and Elizabeth. As it was, the end came before
its time, and like all premature reforms, the
dissolution clashed with the spirit of the age,
and was regarded by the common people as an
injustice. The monks had never driven hard
bargains with their tenants, and their popularity
as landlords was great. Even when their dissolution
was discussed in parliament, the members
showed themselves averse to extreme measures,
and compromised the matter by striking at the
smaller monasteries only. But the insurrection
known as the Pilgrimage of Grace soon gave Henry
VIII. a pretext for their total suppression, and
in 1539, the work of dissolution was finished in
a most ruthless manner. The abbots of Fountains
and Jorvaulx were hanged together at Tyburn,
and the abbot of Glastonbury shared the same
fate. The abbot of Furness, to escape death, was
compelled to sign a deed conveying his whole
estate to the king.</p>

<p>The abbeys were for the most part despoiled
by the people of the district. A stained-glass
window of Furness Abbey was carried off to adorn
Bowness Church, on the banks of Windermere.
An oriel window from Glastonbury Abbey was
used in the building of a neighbouring inn; whilst
the houses of the village owed great part of their
building materials to the destruction of this noble
church. In the case of Crowland, the abbey
seems to have suffered little until the time of
the Civil War, when a band of the Parliament
army destroyed it, after using it as a shelter. In
those instances where man has not wreaked his
vengeance, time and the elements have effected
a slow but sure ruin.</p>

<p>Such was the sudden collapse of these powerful
and at one time useful institutions. Whatever
may have been the faults and drawbacks of their
later existence, they were in earlier periods of
immense service to the country, as they conserved
within them all that was best and highest in
literature, arts, and civilisation. They kept the
lamp of knowledge burning throughout the dark
ages, ready for a time when its light could be
more generally diffused among the nations. And
one thing they did which ought to be held in
grateful remembrance: they were the chief promoters
of the abolition of serfdom, and the manumission
of the slaves, both in England and Scotland.
When giving the rites of the church to the dying
landowner, the monks, although anxious for their
own share of his property, never forgot to plead
for the slaves. And so it came about that, by
the close of the fifteenth century, slavery was
virtually abolished, not by Act of Parliament,
but by the monastic Orders.</p>

<p class="ph3">A STORY IN EIGHT CHAPTERS.<br />
BY T. W. SPEIGHT.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> a certain sunny morning in the pleasant
month of June, in a pleasant room, the French-windows
of which opened on to a terraced garden,
with the gleaming waters of the Channel heaving
and falling no great distance away, sat Mrs
Bowood, wife of Captain James Bowood—formerly
of the mercantile marine, but now of Rosemount,
The Undercliff, Isle of Wight—busily engaged
with her correspondence. Mrs Bowood was a
pleasant-looking woman of some forty summers,
whose brown hair was already tinged with gray.
She had never been accounted a beauty, and she
made no pretensions to a gift with which nature
had failed to endow her. But her dark eyes
looked the home of kindliness and good temper,
with now and then a glint of merry humour
breaking through them; and she possessed the
gift—so precious in a woman—of a voice at once
soft, clear, and persuasive. The verdict of every
one who knew Mrs Bowood was, that the more
you saw of her the better you grew to like
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>{6}</span></p>

<p>All women, whether married or single, like
to have one particular friend to whom they can
open their minds without fearing that their confidence
will be betrayed, to whom they can tell
things that they will tell to no one else, not even
to their husbands. Mrs Bowood’s particular
friend and confidante was a certain Miss Dorothea
Pennell, who, being a lifelong invalid, and consequently
debarred from playing any active part
on the world’s stage, welcomed all the more
eagerly every scrap of news which her correspondent
could send her, and responded all the
more sympathetically, whenever sympathy was
looked for at her hands. It was to Miss Pennell
that Mrs Bowood was this morning inditing her
fortnightly budget of news. As she turns over
the first page and begins on the second, let us
take the liberty of peeping over her shoulder and
of reading what her pen puts down.</p>

<p>‘We are rather more than usually lively at
Rosemount just now,’ she writes; ‘in fact, I
should be justified in saying that we are decidedly
uproarious. You will know, my dear Dolly,
what I mean when I tell you that my sister’s two
youngsters, Freddy and Lucy, are here on a visit.
Maria wanted to go to Paris for a few weeks, so
I gladly offered to take charge of them. Their
sweet childish laughter makes pleasant music in
the old house. I know I shall have a good cry
to myself when the time comes for them to leave
us. They are at once the pride and the torment
of their uncle. You know that my dear old
Bow-wow has a fine natural irritability of temper,
which really means nothing when you come to
know him, and is merely a sort of safety-valve
which, I verily believe, saves him from many a
fit of gout. So, when the youngsters steal his
pocket-handkerchief or hide his spectacles, he
stamps—not with his gouty foot—and storms,
and his red face grows redder—which is quite
unnecessary—and he threatens condign punishment.
Then the children pretend to be frightened,
and hide themselves for a quarter of an hour;
after which they go hand in hand and stand a
little distance away from him and rub a knuckle
in a corner of their eyes. Then of course they
are called up, scolded for half a minute, and
forgiven. Then come lollipops. But all the
time I feel sure that the young monkeys are
laughing at him in their sleeves. Dear old Jamie!
he is as transparent as a sheet of glass, and the
children’s sharp eyes read him through and
through.</p>

<p>‘The other day they found a quantity of coloured
paper, which they persuaded Biggles, their nurse-maid,
to cut up and fashion into so-called “roses.”
Of these paper flowers they made festoons, with
which they decorated themselves; but by-and-by,
seeing their uncle’s white hat on the table in the
hall, the temptation was too much for them, and
forthwith the <i>chapeau</i> was decorated with a wreath
of paper flowers. Then the young imps hid
behind the half-open library door, waiting till
their uncle should set out for his afternoon stroll,
about which he is generally as regular as clock-work.
Presently, out he came, humming some
old sea-song to himself, and took his cane out of
the stand and clapped his hat on his head, never
perceiving—you know how short-sighted he is—that
there was anything amiss with the latter
article, and so went his way; and very comical
he must have looked. As soon as he had disappeared,
the children came out of their hiding-place
and performed a war-dance on the veranda.
Meanwhile, my dear old boy marched gaily on
his way towards Ventnor. He told me afterwards
that he could not make out why people turned
and stared so at him. Before long, he had quite
a gathering of urchins of both sexes following
at his heels—but at a respectful distance, having
probably the fear of his cane in their eyes.
Then a butcher’s boy, as he drove past, called
out: “Hi! Bill, here’s another guy!” This
bewildered the Captain. He turned and glared
at his following, and examined his coat-tails, for
fear anything might have been pinned surreptitiously
behind him; but he never thought of
looking at his hat. It was not till he reached
the outskirts of the town that some one who knew
him stopped him and told him what was the
matter. He came back in a great fume, on castigatory
thoughts intent; but of course the culprits
were not to be found, nor did they venture
to put in an appearance till bedtime, when they
sneaked up-stairs under the wing of Biggles, without
venturing into the drawing-room to bid either
their uncle or me their usual “good-night.” After
this, you will perhaps be surprised to learn that
on peeping into the children’s room about half-past
nine, I found the candles alight, the urchins
sitting up in their beds, and their uncle seated
on a chair between the two, telling them a sea-yarn
and stuffing them with chocolate creams.
What is a poor woman to do with such a husband?</p>

<p>‘And this reminds me that I have promised
my sister to engage a French governess for her
while she is away. Maria has a charming knack
of throwing on to other people’s shoulders any
little worry which she does not care to encounter
herself. What would seem more natural and
proper than that she, whose home is in London,
should engage a governess on the spot. But,
no; she did not care to face the nuisance of
having to pick and select from among a score
or two of candidates, and so delegated the labour
to me, who live here in this out-of-the-way spot.
“You know, dear Caroline, that I lack your
firmness in matters of this sort,” she wrote in
that insinuating way of hers. “I cannot deal
with people as you can. I am impulsive; you
are just the opposite. I should inevitably engage
the first applicant whose appearance pleased me,
without reference to her abilities or anything
else; while you, dear Caroline”—— And so on.
You know Maria’s style.</p>

<p>‘As a consequence of my advertisement, I have
been inundated with letters during the last week—the
postman will want an extra half-crown at
Christmas—all of which I have had to wade
through; the result being that I have selected
half-a-dozen of the most likely candidates to see
personally. I fervently hope that I shall be able
to find one out of the half-dozen that will meet
Maria’s requirements, and so bring this troublesome
business to an end.</p>

<p>‘The day after I posted my last letter to you,
Elsie Brandon came to us on a visit. You will
remember her as being at Rosemount when you
were staying with us last summer. She has shot
up wonderfully in the interim. She is now
seventeen, and is nearly as tall as I am. You<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>{7}</span>
will remember my telling you that she is a ward
in Chancery, and that she will come into a considerable
fortune when she is of age. Her aunt,
Miss Hoskyns, who has charge of her, brought
her to Rosemount to stay for a couple of months.
She is a bright intelligent girl, full of life and
high spirits when away from her severely
methodical aunt. Miss Hoskyns—whose dearest
wish it is to be looked upon as a <i>femme savante</i>,
and who has just started for Italy to decipher
some Etruscan inscriptions which have lately
been unearthed there—would fain train up Elsie
to eschew all thoughts of matrimony, and develop
gradually into a blue-stocking like herself. The
child is learning Latin and mathematics, and is
to begin Greek next winter, and by-and-by go to
Girton College for a couple of years. But I am
afraid that all Miss Hoskyns’ well-meant efforts will
never make a “girl graduate” of Elsie Brandon.
Far dearer to her heart than Latin or mathematics
is a game of lawn-tennis on a sunny afternoon;
and young as she is—unless an old woman
is mistaken—she already knows more of the art
of flirtation than she is likely to know of the
Greek poets as long as she lives. Meanwhile, a
little gentle repression will do her no harm. I
equalise matters by insisting that her studies
shall not be neglected—the Rev. Septimus Dale
comes and coaches her three times a week—but
when once her lessons have been mastered, she
is at liberty to do as she likes. I need scarcely
say that she twists Captain James Bowood round
her little finger.</p>

<p>‘Now that I have written so much about Elsie,
it seems only natural that I should tell you the
latest news about the Captain’s nephew, Charley
Summers, who was such a favourite with you
when you were here. You know already how
he ran through the small fortune which came to
him after his mother’s death; and how, subsequent
to that, his uncle paid his debts twice over.
You know also how, as a last resource, the
Captain placed him in a tea-broker’s office in the
City, and how, after a three months’ trial of office-life,
he broke away from it, and took to the stage
for a living. This was the last straw; and when
James heard that his nephew had turned actor,
he vowed that he should never darken his doors
again, and that he washed his hands of him for
ever. My dear husband had certain prejudices
instilled into his mind when he was young, and
there they live and flourish to the present day.
It is his firm belief that in earning his bread as
he does at present, Charley has irrevocably disgraced
both himself and his family. And yet,
for all that, he still holds the boy as the apple
of his eye. Love and prejudice have been fighting
against each other in his heart, and for the present,
prejudice has carried the day; but if I know
anything of my husband, the victory is only a
temporary one. Love will conquer in the
end.</p>

<p>‘This preamble brings me to the particular
scrap of news anent Charley which I wanted to
tell you. On taking up the local paper yesterday
morning, I happened to notice the advertisement
of a travelling company who are going to play
at the Ryde Theatre during the whole of this
week. Among the list of names mentioned I
found that of Charles Warden—our scapegrace’s
<i>nom de théâtre</i>. This at once set me wondering
whether, now that he is so close to us, he would
venture to come over to Rosemount, in defiance
of his uncle’s express prohibition. I confess that
I should greatly like to see the boy, and yet it
would certainly be better that he should not
venture here for a considerable time to come.</p>

<p>‘But there is another point in connection with
Charley about which I am more curious and
anxious. Do you know, Dolly, I almost fancy
that there is something going on between him
and Elsie? “How absurd!” you will probably
say to yourself. “Why, the girl is only seventeen.”—True;
but girls of seventeen are often
engaged nowadays, and married before they are
eighteen. We live in a precocious age.</p>

<p>‘While Elsie was at Rosemount last year,
Charley came down and stayed a fortnight with
us; it was his last visit before he got into disgrace.
He and Elsie gravitated naturally towards
each other, as young people will do. They
were out and about a great deal together,
and were sometimes missing from breakfast
till dinner-time. I thought nothing of it at
the time, looking upon Elsie as little more
than a child, whereas Charley was already
turned twenty-one. But I was certainly a little
surprised when, in the course of conversation a
few days ago, Elsie let out the fact that Master
Charles had visited at her aunt’s house several
times during the course of the last winter. By
what occult means he contrived to insinuate
himself into the good graces of that she-dragon,
Miss Hoskyns, is more than I can imagine. He
must have found out one of her weak points, for
she is very vain in many ways, and have played
upon it to serve his own ends. I know Charley
too well to believe that he would care to visit
Miss Hoskyns out of regard for that lady herself.
Could it be because he thought there might be
a chance of now and then seeing Elsie, that he
put himself to so much trouble? That there is
some secret understanding between these young
people, I am pretty well convinced; and as an
additional proof of the fact, I may tell you that
when I pointed out Charley’s name in the newspaper
to Elsie, her eyes flashed out suddenly, while
the wild-rose tints in her cheeks grew deeper
and richer. I had never seen the child look so
pretty before.</p>

<p>‘So, then, here is the first chapter of a little
romance working itself out. Should the opportunity
be given me of watching its progress, you
shall hear all about it in due time.’</p>

<p class="p2">As already stated, the French-windows of the
room in which Mrs Bowood was writing stood
wide open this sunny morning. Mrs Bowood
had heard no sound, had seen no shadow; but
while she was writing the last few words, there
suddenly came over her a feeling that she was
no longer alone. She looked up, and could not
help giving a little start when she saw a tall
figure dressed in black standing close to the open
window. Next moment, she smiled to herself
and gave vent to a little sigh. ‘Another applicant
for the post of French governess,’ she murmured.
‘How tiresome to be interrupted in the midst of
one’s correspondence! I will never undertake
another commission for Maria as long as I
live.’</p>

<p>Seeing Mrs Bowood looking at her inquiringly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>{8}</span>
the woman came a step or two nearer, and then
mused, as if in doubt. ‘What shall I say?—how
introduce myself?’ she muttered under her
breath.</p>

<p>She was tall, and with a sort of easy gracefulness
about her which was evidently not acquired, but
natural. It was difficult to guess her age, seeing
that her face, nearly down to her mouth, was hidden
by a veil, which was drawn tightly back over
her bonnet, and tied in a knot behind. But the
veil could not quite hide two flashing black eyes.
She was dressed entirely in black; not a scrap
of any other colour being visible anywhere about
her.</p>

<p>‘You have come in answer to the advertisement?’
queried Mrs Bowood.</p>

<p>‘The advertisement, madame?’ replied the
stranger with evident surprise, as she came a step
or two nearer. She spoke with a slight foreign
accent, which only served to confirm Mrs Bowood’s
first impression.</p>

<p>‘I mean for the French governess’s place,’ continued
the latter lady.</p>

<p>The stranger looked at Mrs Bowood for a
moment without speaking; then she said: ‘Ah—oui,
madame, as you say.’ Then she smiled,
showing as she did so a very white and perfect
set of teeth.</p>

<p>‘I am afraid that I shall not be able to attend
to you for about half an hour,’ said Mrs Bowood
in a tone that was half apologetic. ‘Perhaps you
won’t mind waiting as long as that?’</p>

<p>‘I am at madame’s convenience. I am in no
hurry at all. With madame’s permission, I will
promenade myself in the garden, and amuse
myself with looking at the beautiful flowers.’</p>

<p>‘Do so, by all means. I will send a servant
to tell you when I am ready to see you.’</p>

<p>‘Merci, madame.’ The stranger in black bowed
gracefully, deferentially even, and smiled again.
Then taking up the skirt of her dress with one
hand, she passed out through the French-window.
She paused for a moment in the veranda to put
up her black sunshade, and then she passed slowly
out of sight. But as she walked she communed
with herself: ‘This is fortunate—this will give
me time. I must find some of the servants, and
ask them to direct me. A great deal may be
done in half an hour.’</p>

<p>Left alone, Mrs Bowood took up her pen and
dipped it in the inkstand. ‘Really, many of these
foreigners have very nice manners,’ she mused.
‘We have much to learn from them—not only
in manners, but in the art of dress. That
young person’s gown is made of quite ordinary
material; but the style and fit are enough to
make poor Madame Smithson die of despair.’
Then she took another dip and addressed herself
to the continuation of her letter.</p>

<p class="p2">‘I have a long budget of news for you this
week, my dear Dolly, and as yet, have by no
means come to the end of it.</p>

<p>‘In our many conversations together, I think
you must more than once have heard me mention
Laura Dimsdale’s name, although you may possibly
have forgotten the fact. Well, she has been
staying at Rosemount for the last ten days. But
in order that you may better understand the
position of affairs, I will give you a brief résumé
of her history.</p>

<p>‘You know, of course, that my father was a
country doctor, and that after my mother’s death
I kept his house for many years. When I first
knew Laura Langton—that was her name before
her marriage—she was a girl of ten, home for her
holidays. Her father was vicar of the parish, and
he and my father were well acquainted. Well,
years went on, and Laura grew up into a very
charming young woman. Although there was
quite ten years’ difference in our ages, she and I
were always the best of friends; and whenever
she was at home, I used to have a good deal of
her company. But by-and-by her school-days
were over; and as she was like me, without a
mother, she thought that she could not do better
than follow my example, and become her father’s
housekeeper. Soon after this took place, my
father’s death sent me abroad into the world, and
I left Chilwood for ever. But during the last
summer I lived there, a certain Sir Frederick
Pinkerton, a man about forty years old, used
frequently to ride over to the vicarage—he was
on a visit at some country-house in the neighbourhood—and
village gossip would have it that
he was in love with my pretty Laura. But if
such were the case, nothing ever came of the
affair. By-and-by, Sir Frederick went his way,
and was no more seen in those parts.</p>

<p>‘Some two or three years later, I heard that
Laura was married, and that her husband was
Sir Thomas Dimsdale, a wealthy London merchant,
forty years older than herself. I said to
myself, when I heard the news, that I never
could have believed Laura would have married
merely for money or position. Later on, I heard
the explanation. It appears that her father had
been deluded into mixing himself up with certain
speculations which were to make a rich man of
him, and enable him to leave his daughter a big
fortune; but instead of doing that, they simply
ruined him. In this crisis, Sir Thomas came to
the help of the ruined man. The vicar was
extricated from his difficulties, and his daughter
became Lady Dimsdale. Such bargains are by
no means uncommon in society.</p>

<p>‘Sir Thomas died two years ago; and Laura
found herself a widow at thirty-three years of age,
with an income of something between three and
four thousand pounds a year. So far so good.
But note the sequel. Should Laura marry again,
her income goes from her, all but about four
hundred a year. What a poor contemptible
creature this Sir Thomas must have been!</p>

<p>‘Whether Laura will ever marry again, is of
course more than I can say. I hope with all my
heart that she may do, and this time for love.
She was a very pretty girl, and she is now a very
charming woman, and still very youthful-looking.
And then, too, her life is a very lonely one.
She has no children; her father died years ago;
and she has no near relations left alive. For all
she is so rich, she is by no means a happy
woman.</p>

<p>‘I have made mention of a Sir Frederick
Pinkerton. Would it surprise you to hear that
the individual in question is a neighbour of ours,
and a not unfrequent visitor at Rosemount? He
has taken a house at Bonchurch for a year, on
the recommendation of his doctor. It seems that he
and Captain Bowood met somewhere abroad;
and they have now renewed their acquaintance.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>{9}</span>
Sir Frederick is a bachelor, on the wrong side
of fifty, I should imagine, but young-looking for
his years. He is said to be very rich; but he
has also the reputation of being very stingy. He
comes of a very old family, and is a thorough
man of the world. Remembering that he had
known Lady Dimsdale when she was Laura
Langton and a girl of twenty, I told him one
day, when we met him out driving, that we were
expecting her here on a visit. He coloured up,
on hearing the news, like any young man of five-and-twenty,
a thing which I should scarcely
have believed of an old ex-diplomatist like Sir
Frederick, had I not seen it with my own eyes.
From that moment, I became suspicious.</p>

<p>‘Since Laura’s arrival, Sir Frederick’s visits
to Rosemount have been much more frequent
than before. That he admires her greatly, is
plainly to be seen; but whether he will propose
to her is quite another matter. I hope he will
do nothing of the kind; or rather, I hope that
if he does, she will refuse him. I feel sure that
she does not care a bit for him; and he is not
at all the sort of man that would be likely to
make her happy. But when a woman is lonely,
and feels the need of a home and a settled place
in the world for the remainder of her days,
one can never tell how she may act. Can either
you or I tell how we should act under the same
circumstances? At present, however, this is
beside the question. Sir Frederick has not yet
proposed.</p>

<p>‘But during the last few hours, matters here
have assumed an altogether different complexion.
Last evening, there arrived at Rosemount, on a
short visit, a certain Mr Oscar Boyd, a civil-engineer
of some eminence, who has been out in
South America for several years, engaged in laying
down certain new lines of railway in that
country. Captain Bowood met Mr Boyd for
the first time some two months ago, at his
lawyer’s office in London. It appears that Mr
Boyd is possessed of a small estate, which he is
desirous of selling; and as the estate in question
adjoins certain property belonging to my
husband, it follows as a matter of course that
my dear old Bow-wow is desirous of buying it.
Some difficulty, however, appears to have arisen
with regard to the price, or the conveyance, or
something; so, in order to bring the affair to an
amicable settlement and, as Jamie said, to save
lawyer’s expenses, Mr Boyd has been invited
down here for a few days. The Captain is persuaded
that if he and Mr Boyd can talk over the
affair quietly between themselves, they will be
able to arrive at some agreement which will be
satisfactory to both; and I think it not unlikely
that Jamie will prove to be right.</p>

<p>‘But mark now what follows. When I introduced
Mr Boyd to Lady Dimsdale, soon after his
arrival last evening, judge my surprise to see
them meet as old friends—that is to say, as
friends who had known each other long ago,
but who had not met for many years. A few
words of explanation elicited the fact that Mr
Boyd had made the acquaintance of Laura and
her father during the time that he was employed
as sub-engineer on the Chilwood branch-line of
railway. This, of course, was after I left the
neighbourhood. From the conversation that
followed, I rather fancy that Mr Boyd must have
been a pretty frequent visitor at the vicarage.
There’s something else, too, I rather fancy—that
in those old days there must have been some
flirtation or <i>tendresse</i>, or something of that kind,
between the two young people, the sweet fragrance
of which still lingers in the memory of both
of them. Of course, I may be mistaken in my
idea, but I don’t think I am. More than once
last evening, I said to myself: “Laura is a
widow, Mr Boyd is a widower, why should they
not”’——</p>


<p class="p2">But at this moment a servant flung open the
door and announced: ‘Sir Frederick Pinkerton.’</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> inestimable value of the dog, which, as Sir
Charles Lyell informs us, has been the companion
of man ever since the Neolithic age, is nowhere
more apparent than in the countries encircling
the Arctic Ocean. Besides exercising his powers
in the chase, and defending his master’s person
and cabin from the attacks of rapacious animals,
he fulfils the laborious duty of a beast of burden,
performing the task with an intelligence not
displayed by any other draught animal. Attempts
were formerly made to utilise dogs in this capacity
in various parts of Europe; and it is well known
that in London and many of our provincial towns,
certain breeds were once harnessed to butchers’
carts, costermongers’ flats, and other light conveyances,
until the cruelty involved in compelling
soft-footed quadrupeds to draw laden vehicles
along macadamised roads was at length recognised,
and the evil suppressed.</p>

<p>The legitimate sphere for the employment of
our canine friends for the purposes of draught
is undoubtedly to be found over the frozen wastes
of northern latitudes, where the summer shows
too brief a sun for the growth of much fodder,
and the yielding snow is incapable of supporting
heavier animals. Endowed with remarkable
intelligence, with great powers of endurance, and
with the capability of adaptation to extreme conditions
of climate and various kinds of food, they
seem peculiarly fitted to aid man where his
existence is attended by the severest hardship.
Dogs will exist and labour where other quadrupeds
would perish, and their marvellous instinct
often proves the means of saving life amidst the
dangers which beset the inhabitants of those
inhospitable regions. In Northern Siberia, Kamtchatka,
Greenland, and countries of a similarly
rigorous climate, they are essential alike for the
transport of articles of commerce and for procuring
the necessary means of subsistence. As
early as 1577, Frobisher recorded the fact that
Eskimo sledges were drawn by teams of dogs,
and they have repeatedly proved the indispensable
reliance of modern explorers.</p>

<p>Both the Eskimo and the Siberian sledge-dogs
are large and powerful animals, and, while differing
sufficiently to constitute separate varieties,
they agree in bearing a close resemblance in
their aspect, the tone of their howling, and in
other characteristics to the wolves of the arctic
circle. They stand from thirty to thirty-one and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>{10}</span>
a half inches in height at the shoulder, possess
a pointed muzzle, sharp and erect ears, and a
bushy tail. Their compact and shaggy coat forms
an admirable protection against the cold, and is
therefore much prized among the Eskimo for
clothing. Their colour is variable, the Eskimo
dog presenting almost all shades; but the predominating
hue of this and also of the Siberian
variety is gray or a dingy white.</p>

<p>They subsist principally on fish, walrus-hide,
the flesh or the refuse of seal, and all kinds
of offal. On the arctic shores of Asia, small
fish, cleaned and dried in the open air, are
reserved for the dogs, and form an excellent
spring diet. During winter journeys, the food
is usually served on alternate days, and consists
of fresh frozen fish, or about two pounds of seals’
flesh, or its equivalent in walrus-hide, which is
often frozen like plates of iron, and has to be
chopped or sawn to pieces. They are never permitted
to eat salt junk, except through dire necessity,
and then only sparingly, for a full meal of
it would in many cases be fatal. In summer,
they are turned loose to shift for themselves, and
live partly on field-mice.</p>

<p>Before entering on long expeditions, sledge-dogs
require a careful preparation, very similar to that
which the plundering Turcomans give their
horses. For some time beforehand, their food,
exercise, and rest are strictly regulated. In the
last fortnight, they are driven from seven to
twenty miles daily, halting at stated intervals,
until, like the Turcoman steeds, they are capable
of running from seventy to a hundred English
miles in a day, if the cold be not very intense
and the strain of brief duration. Wrangell states
that when the dogs are pursuing game, they will
cover fifteen versts, and even more, in an hour,
a verst equalling two-thirds of an English mile.
This is confirmed by the experience of Dr Hayes,
who occasionally amused an enforced leisure by
taking an excursion with a team of a dozen dogs,
which would traverse six miles in twenty-eight
to thirty minutes. Their performances over long
distances are even more surprising. On one of
his return journeys, Wrangell sometimes accomplished
a hundred versts per day, and maintained
a mean daily speed of thirty-four miles over a
distance of two hundred and fifty leagues, despite
the fact that the dogs went several days without
food, the stone-foxes and wolverines having
destroyed the provision depôts. Dr Kane’s team,
although worn by previous travel, carried him,
with a fully burdened sledge, between seven
and eight hundred miles in a fortnight, at the
astonishing average rate of fifty-seven miles per
day!</p>

<p>When subjected to severe and protracted exertion,
the dogs are liable to become footsore. They
should then be protected by fur-boots, the paws
being washed frequently in strong brandy, and
if the weather be sufficiently mild, bathed in
sea-water. A similar foot-covering is necessary
when the snow is frozen into hard crystals, which
cut the feet; or when a team is driven rapidly
over sea-ice formed at a low temperature, which,
besides cutting the paws, occasions acute pain
from the brine expressed, sometimes even causing
the animals to fall down in fits. When the cold
is unusually severe, the dogs require clothing for
the body.</p>

<p>Living almost entirely in the open air, these
useful assistants give their masters little trouble
in the provision of kennels. During summer,
they scratch holes in the ground for coolness, or
lie in water to escape mosquitoes. In winter,
when the thermometer is exceptionally low, they
are occasionally sheltered in an outhouse adjoining
the cabin; but even then are more frequently
tethered outside, and curl themselves up in their
burrows in the snow. For the comfort of the
dogs attached to the <i>Fox</i>, while engaged in the
search for Sir John Franklin, some twenty-five
holes were excavated in the face of a snow-bank
alongside the vessel, and ‘in them they spent
most of their time. Under the lee of the ship,
they could, when their fur was thick, lie out on
the snow without apparent inconvenience, although
the temperature was minus forty degrees, and the
mists gave a raw and keen edge to the cutting
blasts.’ Dr Kane erected a doghouse on Butler’s
Island; but the animals would not sleep away
from the vessel, preferring the bare snow within
sound of human voices to a warm kennel on the
rocks. Wrangell says that they relieve their solitary
watches and interrupt the arctic silence with
periodical howling, which is audible at a long
distance, and recurs as a rule at intervals of six
or eight hours, but far more frequently when the
moon shines.</p>

<p>The <i>narti</i> or sledge of Northern Siberia is
nearly two yards long, about twenty-one inches
broad, and ten high. The best are built of
seasoned birchwood, free from knots, except the
bed, which is formed of woven shoots of the sand-willow.
No iron is used in the construction, all
the parts being bound together by thongs cut
from the skin of the elk, ox, or walrus, of which
a great number are required. Eskimo sledges
vary considerably both in form and material,
and are from four to fourteen feet in length; an
ordinary specimen measures ten or twelve feet,
and weighs upwards of two hundred pounds. A
large party of Eskimo who once visited Dr Kane
arrived in sledges ‘made of small fragments of
porous bone, very skilfully fastened together by
thongs of hide; the runners, which shone like
silver, were of highly polished ivory, obtained
from the tusks of the walrus.’ One of Dr Kane’s
sledges, named ‘Little Willie,’ was constructed of
American hickory, thoroughly seasoned, and well
adapted for strength, lightness, and a minimum
amount of friction. Another, styled the ‘Faith,’
which was built in a stronger fashion, after
models furnished by the British Admiralty, measured
thirteen feet long, and four broad, and
would carry fourteen hundredweight of mixed
stores. The natives moisten the soles of the
runners with water, often obtained by dissolving
snow in the mouth, which insures a thin shield
of ice that glides over a frozen surface with
incredible ease.</p>

<p>When the sledge is laden, the whole is covered
by thin sheets of deerskin, so as to prevent displacement
of the load by the rapid speed or the
frequent overthrows. Under favourable circumstances,
a team will draw from a thousand to
twelve hundred and sixty pounds, or from nine to
eleven and a quarter hundredweight, in addition
to the driver, at the rate of seven or eight miles
an hour; but during intense frost, when the snow
is rendered granular, and ‘almost as gritty as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>{11}</span>
sand,’ the load may have to be limited to three
hundred and sixty pounds.</p>

<p>A good team consists of about twelve dogs.
Their harness is composed of bearskin, and when
tethered, it is by bear or seal skin traces fastened
to spears plunged into the ice. The foremost
sledge is furnished with an additional dog to act as
leader, which receives a careful training, for on
him the safety of the whole party frequently
depends. If reliable, no difficulty turns him aside,
but he selects the track which presents the least
danger. On dark nights, or when the wild waste
is obscured by a tempest, an impenetrable mist,
or a blinding snowstorm, and the sheltering
<i>powarna</i> is scarcely discoverable by man, a good
leader will be sure to find it, if he has ever crossed
the plain before, or once rested at the habitation;
while, if the hut be buried in snow, he will
indicate the spot where his master must dig.
When successfully trained, he rarely runs astray
on scenting game; and often excites the admiration
of travellers by his persistent efforts to keep
the rest of the team to their work, barking and
wheeling round at intervals, as if he had come
upon a new scent, in order to induce them to
follow him. If the leader swerves from duty, the
driver not unfrequently finds himself powerless
on such occasions to prevent them from rushing
madly off in pursuit of prey.</p>

<p>At all times, the task of driving these half-tamed
wolfish dogs is one of considerable difficulty,
requiring both skill and determination. The
sleighman seats himself on one side of the sledge,
with his feet on the runner, and must be ready
to spring off at any moment when his safety may
be imperilled, or to dig his heels into the snow,
if the fierce and unruly animals refuse to stop
when they are required. A long staff, furnished
with iron at one end and bells at the other, serves
the double purpose of assisting him to maintain
his precarious seat on the rocking sledge, and aids
his voice in giving animation to the team by the
tintinnabulation of the bells. A far more formidable
instrument is the driver’s whip. The lash
measures twenty feet in length, or four feet more
than the traces, and is made of raw seal or walrus
hide, tipped with a ‘cracker’ of hard sinew.
Attached to a light stock only two and a half
feet long, no little practice is necessary to roll
such a lash out to its full length, and when
blown in all directions by an arctic gale, will tax
the powers of the most experienced hand.</p>

<p>But sledge-dogs need no urging with the whip
when their instinct informs them that they are on
unsafe ice. They flee onwards at the speed which
alone can save, and, as was experienced repeatedly
by Dr Hayes, instead of keeping the sledges
together in a compact body, they diverge and
separate, so as to distribute the weight over as
large an area as possible. When they begin to find
themselves menaced by this danger, and the prospect
ahead appears to them unusually threatening,
‘they tremble, lie down, and refuse to go further.’
Most arctic explorers tell of hairbreadth escapes
from treacherous ice, when they have owed their
preservation to the sagacity of their dogs. Wrangell
relates an incident of this nature: ‘Our first
care was to examine the possibility of further
advance; this, however, could only be done by
trusting to the thin ice of the channel, and
opinions were divided as to the possibility of
its bearing us. I determined to try; and the
adventure succeeded better than could have been
hoped for, owing to the incredibly swift running
of the dogs, to which doubtless we owed our safety.
The leading sledge actually broke through in
several places; but the dogs, warned, no doubt,
of the danger by their natural instinct, and
animated by the incessant cries and encouragement
of the driver, flew so rapidly over the
yielding ice, that we reached the other side without
actually sinking through. The other three
sledges followed with similar rapidity, each across
such part as appeared to be the most promising;
and we were now all assembled in safety on the
north side of the fissure. It was necessary to
halt for a time, to allow the dogs to recover a
little from their extraordinary exertions.’</p>

<p>Some authorities, including Dr Hayes, pronounce
these dogs to be insensible to kindness;
but the assertion has been stoutly disputed. The
fact appears to be that sledge-dogs, like all others,
bark as they are bred, or, in other words, are
what their masters make them. When they
receive humane treatment, instead of the systematic
and revolting brutality which is too commonly
their portion, they rarely fail to evince a
warm attachment to those with whom they
are associated. ‘Daddy,’ the Eskimo dog which
served for three years in the search for Sir John
Franklin, ‘won all hearts by his winning manner
both afloat and ashore.’ A lithograph of this
cherished animal is preserved in the British
Museum. Similar testimony in proof of the
friendly and often affectionate disposition of these
dogs, when properly treated, is borne by various
explorers.</p>

<p>No greater calamity could befall the inhabitants
of such regions than to be deprived
of the services of the dog. To avert such
a disaster, human mothers will nurse pups with
their own offspring, if, through the death of the
natural mother, there appear danger of the family
being left without the preserving dog. It was
once proposed in Northern Siberia to prohibit
the keeping of dogs, because their large consumption
of food was believed to lessen the
quantity available for the inhabitants; but the
enforcement of such a prohibition would have
robbed the people of one of their chief means
of subsistence.</p>

<p>The reindeer may be turned to a greater variety
of uses than the dog, but, on the other hand, is
more difficult to maintain. Over immense tracts
of country, almost all articles of food and of
commerce, together with the abundant supplies
of fuel and oil necessary to impart warmth,
light, and cheerfulness to the hovels in which
the inhabitants seek refuge from their inconceivably
severe and sunless winters, are obtained
by the help of dogs. They convey their masters
to and from fishing-grounds more distant than
could otherwise be visited. They discover the
lurking-places of the wary seal. Harnessed to
light sledges, and guided by keenness of scent,
or by visible traces on the freshly fallen snow,
they fly over hummock and hollow in pursuit of
the elk, the reindeer, the fox, sable, squirrel, the
wild-sheep, and the bear, thus bringing hunters
within reach alike of the fleetest, the craftiest,
and the most formidable prey. In a word, the
dog is as indispensable to the settled inhabitants<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>{12}</span>
of such climes, as the reindeer is to the nomad
tribes, as the horse is in England, the sure-footed
mule on the mountain-paths of Spain, the llama
on those of South America, or as the camel in
the sandy deserts of Africa and Arabia.</p>

<h3>I.—JAMES THARDOVER.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A weather-beaten</span> man stood by a gateway
watching some teams at plough. The bleak
March wind rushed across the field, reddening
his face; rougher than a flesh-brush, it rubbed
the skin, and gave it a glow as if each puff were
a blow with the ‘gloves.’ His short brown beard
was full of dust blown into it. Between the line
of the hat and the exposed part of the forehead,
the skin had peeled slightly, literally worn off by
the unsparing rudeness of wintry mornings. Like
the early field veronica, which flowered at his
feet in the short grass under the hedge, his eyes
were blue and gray. The petals are partly of
either hue, and so his eyes varied according to
the light—now somewhat more gray, and now
more blue. Tall and upright, he stood straight
as a bolt, though both arms were on the gate
and his ashen walking-stick swung over it. He
wore a gray overcoat, a gray felt hat, gray
leggings, and his boots were gray with the dust
which had settled on them.</p>

<p>He was thinking: ‘Farmer Bartholomew is
doing the place better this year; he scarcely
hoe’d a weed last season; the stubble was a
tangle of weeds; one could hardly walk across it.
That second team stops too long at the end
of the furrow—idle fellow that. Third team
goes too fast; horses will be soon tired. Fourth
team—he’s getting beyond his work—too old;
the stilts nearly threw him over there. This
ground has paid for the draining—one, at all
events. Never saw land look better. Looks
brownish and moist; moist brownish red. Query,
what colour is that? Ask Mary—the artist.
Never saw it in a picture. Keeps his hedges
well; this one is like a board on the top, thorn-boughs
molten together; a hare could run along
it (as they will sometimes with harriers behind
them, and jump off the other side to baffle scent).
Now, why is Bartholomew doing his land better
this year? Keen old fellow. Something behind
this. Has he got that bit of money that was
coming to him? Done something, they said, last
Doncaster; no one could get anything out of
him. Dark as night. Sold the trainer some
oats; that I know; wonder how much the trainer
pocketed over that transaction? Expect he did
not charge them all. Still, he’s a decent fellow.
Honesty is uncertain—never met an honest man.
Doubt if world could hang together. Bartholomew
is honest enough; but either he has won some
money, or he really does not want the drawback
at audit. Takes care his horses don’t look
too well. Notice myself that farmers do not
let their teams look so glossy as a few years
ago. Like them to seem rough and uncared
for—can’t afford smooth coats, these hard times.
Don’t look very glossy myself; don’t feel very
glossy. Hate this wind—hang kings’ ransoms.
People who like these winds are telling falsehoods.
That’s broken’ (as one of the teams
stopped); ‘have to send to blacksmith; knock off
now; no good your pottering there. Next team
stops to go and help potter. Third team stops
to help second. Fourth team comes across to
help third. All pottering. Wants Bartholomew
among them. That’s the way to do a morning’s
work. Did any one ever see such idleness!
Group about a broken chain—link snapped. Tie
it up with your leathern garter—not he; no
resource. What patience a man needs, to have
anything to do with land. Four teams idle
over a snapped link. Rent!—of course they
can’t pay rent. Wonder if a gang of American
labourers could make anything out of our farms?
There they work from sunrise to sunset. Suppose
import a gang and try. Did any one ever see
such a helpless set as that yonder! Depression—of
course. No go-ahead in them.’</p>

<p>‘Mind opening the gate, you?’ said a voice
behind; and turning, the thinker saw a dealer in
a trap, who wanted the gate opened, to save him
the trouble of getting down to do it himself.
The thinker did as he was asked, and held the
gate open. The trap went slowly through.</p>

<p>‘Will you come on and take a glass?’ said the
dealer, pointing with the butt-end of his whip.
‘<i>Crown</i>.’ This was sententious for the <i>Crown</i> in
the hamlet; country-folk speak in pieces, putting
the principal word in a sentence for the entire
paragraph.</p>

<p>The thinker shook his head and shut the gate,
carefully hasping it. The dealer drove on.</p>

<p>‘Who’s that?’ thought the gray man, watching
the trap jolt down the rough road. ‘Wants
veal, I suppose; no veal here, no good.—Now,
look!’</p>

<p>The group by the broken chain beckoned to
the trap; a lad went across to it with the chain,
got up, and was driven off, so saving himself
half a mile on his road to the forge.</p>

<p>‘Anything to save themselves exertion. Nothing
will make them move faster—like whipping
a carthorse into a gallop; it soon dies away in
the old jog-trot. Why—they have actually started
again! actually started!’</p>

<p>He watched the teams a little longer, heedless
of the wind, which he abused, but which really
did not affect him, and then walked along the
hedgerow down hill. Two men were sowing a
field on the slope, swinging the hand full of grain
from the hip regular as time itself, a swing calculated
to throw the seed so far, but not too far,
and without jerk. The next field had just been
manured, and he stopped to glance at the crowds
of small birds which were looking over the straw—finches
and sparrows, and the bluish gray of pied
wagtails. There were hundreds of small birds.
While he stood, a hedge-sparrow uttered his thin
pleading song on the hedge-top, and a meadow-pipit
which had mounted a little way in the air,
came down with outspread wings with a short
‘Seep, seep,’ to the ground. Lark and pipit seem
near relations; only the skylark sings rising,
descending, anywhere; but the pipits chiefly
while slowly descending. There had been a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>{13}</span>
rough attempt at market-gardening in the field
after this, and rows of cabbage gone up to seed
stood forlorn and ragged. On the top of one of
these, a skylark was perched, calling at intervals;
for though classed as a non-percher, perch he does
sometimes. Meadows succeeded on the level
ground—one had been covered with the scrapings
of roads, a whitish, crumbling dirt, dry and
falling to pieces in the wind. The grass was
pale, its wintry hue not yet gone, and the clods
seemed to make it appear paler. Among these
clods, four or five thrushes were seeking their
food; on a bare oak, a blackbird was perched,
his mate no doubt close by in the hedgerow; at
the margin of a pond, a black-and-white wagtail
waded in the water; a blue tit flew across to the
corner. Brown thrushes, dark blackbird, blue
tit, and wagtail, gave a little colour to the angle
of the meadow. A gleam of passing sunlight
brightened it. Two wood-pigeons came to a
thick bush growing over a gray wall on the other
side; for ivy-berries, probably.</p>

<p>A cart passed at a little distance, laden with
red mangolds, fresh from the pit in which they
had been stored; the roots had grown out a trifle,
and the rootlets were mauve. A goldfinch
perched on a dry dead stalk of wild carrot, a
stalk that looked too slender to bear the bird.
As the weather-beaten man moved, the goldfinch
flew, and the golden wings outspread formed a
bright contrast with the dull white clods.
Crossing the meadow, and startling the wood-pigeons,
our friend scaled the gray wall, putting
his foot in a hole left for the purpose. Dark
moss lined the interstices between the irregular
and loosely placed stones. Above, on the bank,
and greener than the grass, grew moss at the
roots of ash-stoles and wherever there was shelter.
Broad rank green arum leaves crowded each other
in places. Red stalks of herb-Robert spread open.
The weather-beaten man gathered a white wild
violet from the shelter of a dead dry oak-leaf, and
as he placed it in his button-hole, paused to listen
to the baying of hounds. Yowp! yow! The
cries echoed from the bank and filled the narrow
beechwood within. A shot followed, and then
another, and a third after an interval. More
yowping. The gray-brown head of a rabbit
suddenly appeared over the top of the bank,
within three yards of him, and he could see
the creature’s whiskers nervously working, as
its mind estimated its chances of escape. Instead
of turning back, the rabbit made a rush to get
under an ash-stole where was a burrow. The
yowping went slowly away; the beeches rang
again as if the beagles were in cry. Two assistant-keepers
were working the outskirts, and shooting
the rabbits which sat out in the brushwood, and
so were not to be captured by nets and ferrets.
The ground-game was strictly kept down; the
noise was made by half-a-dozen puppies they had
with them. Passing through the ash-stoles, and
next the narrow beechwood, the gray man walked
across the open park, and after awhile came in
sight of Thardover House. His steps were directed
to the great arched porch, beneath which the
village-folk boasted a waggon-load could pass.
The inner door swung open as if by instinct at
his approach. The man who had so neighbourly
opened the gate to the dealer in the trap was
James Thardover, the owner of the property.
Historic as was his name and residence, he was
utterly devoid of affectation; a true man of the
land.</p>


<h3>II.—NEW TITLE-DEEDS.</h3>

<p>Deed, seal, and charter give but a feeble hold
compared with that which is afforded by labour.
James Thardover held his lands again by right
of labour; he had taken possession of them once
more with thought, design, and actual work, as
his ancestors had with the sword. He had
laid hands, as it were, on every acre. Those
who work, own. There are many who receive
rent who do not own; they are proprietors, not
owners; like receiving dividends on stock, which
stock is never seen or handled. Their rights are
legal only; his right was the right of labour,
and it might be added, of forbearance. It is a
condition of ownership in the United States that
the settler clears so much and brings so many
acres into cultivation. It was just this condition
which he had practically carried out upon the
Thardover estate. He had done so much, and in
so varied a manner, that it is difficult to select
particular acts for enumeration. All the great
agricultural movements of the last thirty years
he had energetically supported. There was the
draining movement. The undulating contour of
the country, deep vales alternating with moderate
brows, gave a sufficient supply of water to every
farm, and on the lower lands led to flooding and
the formation of marshes. Horley Bottom, where
the hay used to be frequently carried into the
river by a June freshet, was now safe from flood.
Flag Marsh had been completely drained, and
made some of the best wheat-land in the neighbourhood.
Part of a bark canoe was found in
it; the remnants were preserved at Thardover
House, but gradually fell to pieces.</p>

<p>Longboro’ Farm was as dry now as any such soil
could be. More or less draining had been carried
out on twenty other farms, sometimes entirely at
his expense; sometimes the tenant paid a small
percentage on the sum expended; generally this
percentage fell off in the course of a year or
two. The tenant found that he could not pay it.
Except on Flag Marsh, the drainage did not
pay him fifty pounds. Perhaps it might have
done, had the seasons been better; but, as it
had actually happened, the rents had decreased
instead of increasing. Tile-pipes had not availed
against rain and American wheat. So far as
income was concerned, he would have been
richer had the money so expended been allowed
to accumulate at the banker’s. The land as
land was certainly improved in places, as on
Bartholomew’s farm. Thardover never cared for
the steam-plough; personally, he disliked it.
Those who represented agricultural opinion at
the farmers’ clubs and in the agricultural papers,
raised so loud a cry for it, that he went halfway
to meet them. One of the large tenants was
encouraged to invest in the steam-plough by a
drawback on his rent, on condition that it should
be hired out to others. The steam-plough,
Thardover soon discovered, was not profitable to
the landowner. It reduced the fields to a dead
level; they had previously been thrown into
‘lands,’ with a drain-trench on each side. On this
dead level, water did not run off quickly, and the
growth of weeds increased. Tenants got into a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>{14}</span>
habit of shirking the extirpation of the weeds.
The best farmers on the estate would not use it
at all. To very large tenants, and to small tenants
who could not keep enough horses, it was profitable
at times. It did not appear that a single
sack more of wheat was raised, nor a single
additional head of stock maintained, since the
steam-plough arrived.</p>

<p>Paul of Embersbury, who occupied some of
the best meadow and upland country, a man
of some character and standing, had taken to
the shorthorns before Thardover succeeded to
the property. Thardover assisted him in every
way, and bought some of the best blood. There
was no home-farm; the House was supplied
from Bartholomew’s dairy, and the Squire did not
care to upset the old traditionary arrangements
by taking a farm in hand. What he bought
went to Embersbury, and Paul did well. As a
consequence, there were good cattle all over the
estate. The long prices formerly fetched by
Paul’s method had much fallen off; but substantial
sums were still paid. Paul had faced
the depression better than most of them. He was
bitter, as was only natural, against the reaction
in favour of black-cattle. The upland tenants,
though, had a good many of the black, despite of
Paul’s frowns and thunders after the market
ordinary at Barnboro’ town. He would put down
his pipe, bustle upon his feet, lean his somewhat
protuberant person on the American leather of
the table, and address the dozen or so who stayed
for spirits-and-water after dinner, without the
pretence of a formal meeting. He spoke in very
fair language, short, jerky sentences, but well-chosen
words. He who had taken the van in
improvements thirty years ago, was the bitterest
against any proposed change now. Black-cattle
were thoroughly bad.</p>

<p>Another of his topics was the hiring-fair,
where servant-girls stood waiting for engagements,
and which it was proposed to abolish.
Paul considered it was taking the bread-and-cheese
out of the poor wenches’ mouths. They
could stand there and get hired for nothing,
instead of having to pay half-a-crown for
advertising, and get nothing then. But though
the Squire had supported the shorthorns, even
the shorthorns had not prevented the downward
course things agricultural were following.</p>

<p>Then there was the scientific movement,
the cry for science among the farmers. He
founded a scholarship, invited the professors to
his place, lunched them, let them experiment on
little pieces of land, mournful-looking plots.
Nothing came of it. He drew a design for a
new cottage himself, a practical plain place; the
builders told him it was far dearer to put up
than ornamental but inconvenient structures.
Thardover sunk his money his own way, and
very comfortable cottages they were. Ground-game
he had kept down for years before the
Act. Farm-buildings he had improved freely.
The education movement, however, stirred him
most. He went into it enthusiastically. Thardover
village was one of the first places to become
efficient under the new legislation. This was
a piece of practical work after his own heart.
Generally, legislative measures were so far off from
country-people. They affected the condition of
large towns, of the Black Country, of the weavers
or miners, distant folk. To the villages and
hamlets of purely agricultural districts these Acts
had no existence. The Education Act was just
the reverse. This was a statute which came right
down into the hamlets, which was nailed up at
the crossroads, and ruled the barn, the plough, and
scythe. Something tangible, that could be carried
out and made into a fact; something he could
do. Thardover did it with the thoroughness
of his nature. He found the ground, lent the
money, saw to the building, met the government
inspectors, and organised the whole. A Committee
of the tenants were the ostensible authority, the
motive-power was the Squire. He worked at it
till it was completely organised, for he felt as
if he were helping to mould the future of this
great country. Broad-minded himself, he understood
the immense value of education, looked
at generally; and he thought, too, that by its
aid the farmer and the landowner might be
enabled to compete with the foreigner, who
was driving them from the market. No speeches
and no agitation could equal the power concentrated
in that plain school-house; there was
nothing from which he hoped so much.</p>

<p>Only one held aloof and showed hostility to the
movement, or rather to the form it took. His
youngest and favourite daughter, Mary, the artist,
rebelled against it. Hitherto, she had ruled him
as she chose. She had led in every kind act;
acts too kind to be called charity; she had been,
the life of the place. Perhaps it was the strong-minded
women whom the cry of education brought
to Thardover House, that set ajar some chord in
her sensitive mind. Strident voices checked her
sympathies, and hard rule-and-line work like
this repelled her. Till then, she had been the
constant companion of the Squire’s walks; but
while the school was being organised, she would
not go with him. She walked where she could
not see the plain angular building; she said it
set her teeth on edge.</p>

<p>When the strident voices had departed, when
time had made the school-house part and
parcel of the place, like the cottages, Mary
changed her ways, and occasionally called there.
She took a class once a week of the elder
girls, and taught them in her own fashion
at home—most unorthodox teaching, it was—in
which the works of the best poets were
the chief subjects, and portfolios of engravings
were found on the table. Long since, father and
daughter had resumed their walks together.</p>

<p>It was in this way that James Thardover made
his estate his own—he held possession by right
of labour. He was resident ten months out of
twelve; and after all these public and open
works, he did far more in private. There was
not an acre on the property which he had not
personally visited. The farmhouses and farm-buildings
were all known to him. He rode from
tenancy to tenancy, he visited the men at plough
and stood among the reapers. Neither the
summer heat nor the winds of March prevented
him from seeing with his own eyes. The latest
movement was the silo-system, the burying of
grass under pressure, instead of making it into
hay. By these means, the clouds are to be defied,
and a plentiful supply of fodder secured. Time
alone can show whether this, the latest invention,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>{15}</span>
is any more powerful than steam-plough or
guano to uphold agriculture against the shocks
of fortune. But James Thardover would have
tried any plan that had been suggested to him.
It was thus that he laid hold on his lands with
the strongest of titles, the work of his own hands.
Yet still the tenants were unable to pay the
former rent; some had failed or left, and their
farms were vacant; and nothing could be more
discouraging than the condition of affairs upon
the property.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="AN_ORDER_OF_MERCY">AN ORDER OF MERCY.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has from time to time fallen to our lot
to point out efforts, both good and bad, for
the relief of suffering; and whilst we never
shrink from deprecating the so-called charity
which enfeebles and harms its recipients, it is
with genuine pleasure that we draw attention
to schemes of real utility and helpfulness. Of
the last-named order, we can confidently affirm,
is the St John Ambulance Association, the working
of which it is the object of the present paper
to explain. The Association was founded in England
in 1877, under the auspices of the Order of
St John of Jerusalem, and has for its object the
spread of such elementary knowledge as may tend
to decrease avoidable suffering in cases of accident
or injury. Many have known by sad experience
the helplessness of bystanders, say in an ordinary
street-accident, and have seen how, with the best
will in the world, the power to aid the sufferer
was utterly wanting, and he has had to be left
to his fate till medical help could be procured.
Alas! it not seldom happens that by the time
help arrives, there is no longer scope for the
doctor’s skill, and so many a life has been lost
for want of the knowledge of how to administer
prompt measures for relief.</p>

<p>As an instance of successful unprofessional help,
take the following case of a man who was seen
by a policeman to fall against an iron railing
with such force as to completely sever an artery.
The policeman, a pupil of one of the St John
Ambulance classes, so cleverly extemporised a
compress and bandages that the bleeding was
entirely arrested. On the temporary appliance
being removed at one of the London hospitals,
the hemorrhage returned with so much violence,
that the surgeon in attendance declared that
nothing but the prompt aid rendered by the
policeman could have averted speedy death.</p>

<p>But even when the accident is not so serious
as to involve the question of life or death, much
needless suffering is often caused by the roughness
or carelessness of unskilled handling, and recovery
is in consequence greatly retarded. The following
instance, both of this and of the advantages
of skilled assistance, is taken from the
Register of the Association. It is the case
of a carter who had his leg broken by a
fall whilst at work and at a distance from
medical help. Two successful candidates of an
ambulance class extemporised splints, bandages,
and a stretcher, and conveyed the wounded man
to a doctor’s house. As a consequence of the
injured limb having been properly supported, the
patient was able to get out of bed in three weeks’
time, and in less than two months was walking
about with ease. Five years previously he had
met with a similar accident under corresponding
circumstances: but no skilled help being at hand,
he was conveyed home somewhat roughly, a proceeding
which revenged itself by sixteen weeks of
helplessness and suffering.</p>

<p>Such cases are of daily, almost hourly occurrence
in our large towns, whilst in mining or
manufacturing districts, the risks to life and limb
are even more serious and frequent; so that any
agency which provides the needed help to such
sufferers cannot but be looked upon as a boon
to humanity. Now, it is just this first prompt
aid that the Association seeks, through its pupils,
to place within the reach of all those who are
overtaken by sudden accident or injury; and in
order to disseminate the necessary knowledge,
classes for instruction are held wherever the
requisite number—twenty to thirty—of pupils
are found willing to prepare themselves to be
in readiness to give help in case of need. The
course of instruction is limited to a series of five
lectures, according to a syllabus drawn up by a
Committee of medical men of eminence. It consists
of a general slight outline of the structure
and functions of the human body, including
particular notice of the principal arteries and of
the different forms of hemorrhage, with the various
extemporary means for its arrest, including the
use of bandages. Fractured bones also receive
a considerable share of attention. The fourth
lecture is devoted to the consideration of insensible
patients, the treatment of the apparently
drowned, and of the victims to burns, scalds, and
various smaller ills. So far, the instruction is the
same for male and female pupils; but in the last
lecture the lines diverge; and whilst women
receive some hints on home-nursing, men are
instructed as to the best methods of lifting and
carrying the sick and injured, with or without
stretchers. The last half-hour of each lesson is
devoted to practice by the pupils of such arts as
the application of splints and bandages, and the
conveying from place to place of patients <i>pro tem</i>.</p>

<p>For ladies’ classes, a small boy is hired as
dummy, and is put through such a series of
possible accidents as ought to sober the most reckless
of mortals into a cautious habit of life. The
sight of a group of eager watchers for a vacant
limb is decidedly entertaining; and it is curious
to notice the contrast between the utter want of
comprehension of some aspirants, and the quickness
with which other deft fingers carry out an
idea once grasped.</p>

<p>Pupils who pass an examination, partly written
and partly practical, which is held at the end of
each course of lectures, are presented with certificates
of proficiency; and for women only, there
is a second course of instruction in the elements
of hygiene and home-nursing.</p>

<p>A record, well worth studying, is kept by the
Association of cases successfully treated by its
pupils; and a list is also kept of those holding
certificates who would be willing to join an ambulance
train in case of war.</p>

<p>It need scarcely be said that the work of the
Association in no sense seeks to supersede or
interfere with the doctor’s help; and it is pleasing
to find that in no case has complaint been made
of over-officiousness or presumption on the part
of any one pupil. Indeed, the little knowledge
so conveyed would be more likely to have a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>{16}</span>
contrary effect, and to make the amateur pause
and consider, before venturing to trifle with such
a wonderful and intricate piece of mechanism
as the human body. Few of us are without
at least one ‘friend’ who is ready at a
moment’s notice to prescribe some quack remedy,
from the deadly poison of soothing sirup, to the
comparatively harmless ‘globule’ of the homeopathist,
and to do so with an air of profound conviction,
even in cases where the doctor of learning
and experience hesitates to give an opinion.</p>

<p>Now, anything that would tend to foster ignorant
presumption is carefully avoided in the
ambulance class, the instructor and examiner of
which are invariably medical men; and only that
amount of knowledge is imparted which will
enable pupils to give help of the <i>right kind</i>, until
the doctor arrives. Pupils in a position to do so,
pay a small fee; but as the work of the Association
increases rapidly amongst miners, colliers, railway-porters,
policemen, and others, who cannot afford
to contribute towards the necessary working expenses,
whilst they constitute just the class to
whom instruction is most valuable, increased support
from those who have it in their power to
give is very greatly needed; and as the work is
undertaken, in great part, as a labour of love,
donors may have the satisfaction of feeling that
their gifts go directly towards the formation of
new centres of usefulness.</p>

<p>In order to complete the work of the Association,
a varied stock of <i>matériel</i> has been prepared
and widely distributed by means of the Store
Department. Of the first Handbook prepared for
the use of classes, no fewer than fifty thousand
copies have been issued, as well as a large number
of special Manuals for the advanced or nursing
class. It was also found necessary to supply the
classes with diagrams for the use of lecturers, and
with an assortment of such articles as bandages,
splints, &amp;c. The Association has also prepared
a small portable hamper in a waterproof case,
fitted with those ‘First Aid’ appliances, the use
of which is taught in the classes. Much time
and thought has been expended on the production
of a stretcher at once light, easily managed, and
comfortable; the result has been a small vehicle
known as the ‘Ashford’ litter, consisting of a
covered stretcher moving on two wheels, which
can in ordinary cases be managed by one person.
Such a hamper and litter have, during the past
year, been placed in two lodges of Hyde Park;
and it needs little prophetic insight to predict
that in a short time our public buildings will
boast a supply of the wherewithal for dealing
with cases of accident or emergency.</p>

<p>The latest idea, which awaits full organisation,
is the formation of Ambulance Corps for the
transport of sick (non-infectious cases) and injured
in large towns, where the distance is of necessity
great. In London, there are no proper arrangements
for the removal of the infirm, the few
vehicles to be had being unsuitable for the
purpose and costly to hire; facts which show
the need of help, such as an organised Ambulance
Corps would be able to give at a moment’s
notice.</p>

<p>Some idea may be formed of the spread of the
Association’s work by the fact that during the
past year twenty-five thousand men and women
have received instruction in London and the
provinces. Of these, eight thousand have successfully
passed examinations and have received certificates
of proficiency. There are at present
ten centres of work in London, and about one
hundred and forty in the country; and in addition,
the idea has taken root and is spreading in
the principal countries of Europe and in all our
colonies. But cheering as has been the progress,
the promoters of this scheme look forward to
still better things in the future, and hopefully
anticipate the time when avoidable suffering shall
be reduced to a minimum, through a widespread
knowledge of the elements of helpfulness.</p>

<p>Any further information respecting the working
of the Association and the formation of new
classes can be obtained on application to the
chief secretary, Captain Perrott, St John’s Gate,
Clerkenwell, London.</p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
